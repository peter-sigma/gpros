3. Development Plan
To build this platform efficiently, we need to structure the development process into phases:

Phase 1: Planning and Setup
Project Planning:
Outline the development roadmap and set milestones.
Assign responsibilities between you (Gicheha, software engineer) and Gichuhi (transcription expertise).
Tech Stack:
Backend: Django (Python) for its robust framework and scalability.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (possibly React.js for a dynamic UI).
Database: PostgreSQL for secure data management.
Storage: Amazon S3 or Azure Blob for file storage.
Version Control: Set up a GitHub repository for version tracking and collaboration.
Phase 2: Core Feature Development
User Authentication:
Build the user registration and login system.
Implement role-based authentication and 2FA.
Client Dashboard:
Develop a user-friendly dashboard with an overview and file upload functionality.
Integrate order placement features with custom options and a pricing calculator.
